<h2 id="get-started-with-python">Get started with Python</h2>
<p><strong>Submission intructions: submit to Moodle</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to get familiar with Python and begin to using course resources to collaborate with your classmates. Please complete this by Tuesday 2/11.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Get up and running with an Anaconda for Python 3.7 installation on your personal computer. See the Getting started with Python page in the General section of Moodle.</p></li>
<li><p>Spend an hour or two with one or more of the Python resources on the course overview / policies page.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a program that uses NumPy creates two 100 x 100 arrays, then adds them together in two different ways: first by using a double for loop, and then by using the ‘+’ operator. Time how long each method takes to add the matrices.</p></li>
<li><p>Time each method 1000 times and record the timing results in a vector of length 1000. For each method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Print the average and standard deviation of the running time</li>
<li>Plot a histogram of the running times</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Write a small example program of your own choosing. Clearly describe in the comments what the program is supposed to do, and make sure we can run it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please consider this a <strong>collaborative exercise</strong> to be solved with your classmates. Post to Piazza early and often. We want to hear from you!</p>
